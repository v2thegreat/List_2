However, in the event that any of these issues occurs, we recommend that you by a lottery ticket BEFORE calling for help, as you've had the probability of that happening is the same as two shuffled decks of cards being the exactly the same.

In the event that you don't win the lottery, we would like you to relish in the fact that for a very short time, you were the luckiest person in the universe and we would like to congratulate you for this.
